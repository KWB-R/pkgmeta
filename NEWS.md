# [pkgmeta 0.2.2](https://github.com/KWB-R/pkgmeta/releases/tag/v0.2.2) <small>2024-03-20</small>

Make sure that dependency [packrat](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat) is 
installed from GitHub in version `0.7.0`, as in later versions the behavior of 
`packrat:::recursivePackageDependencies()` changed and is incompatible with this 
package. 

To do in later releases: check what has been changed or check alternative approaches 
for finding the reverse dependencies.
